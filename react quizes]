  Learn Once, Write Anywhere 
Nice One! One great thing about React is that it works in a few different environments. Once you learn the key concepts of working with React to create client-side web applications, you can also more easily learnReact NativeLinks to an external site. and write native mobile apps using React, or use tools like Next.jsLinks to an external site. andGatsbyLinks to an external site. to write server-rendered React.

  Declarative 
Correct!

React helps us write declarative code, which makes our code easier to understand. Declarative code:

Describes what a program should accomplish (or what the end result should be)
Leaves the determination of how to get to the end result up to the program
  Component-Based 
Yes!

React encourages us to structure our applications as "components": the building blocks of our web page that handle their own data and UI logic, that can be "composed" together with other components to put together a complete app.

Question 2

Of the code examples below, which uses declarative syntax?
  
const header = document.createElement("h1");
header.textContent = "Hi!";
header.className = "main";
const container = document.querySelector("#container");
container.append(header);
  I don't know.
  
const header = <h1 className="main">Hello from React!h1>;

ReactDOM.render(header, document.querySelector("#container"));
Correct!

With declarative syntax, we are able to leave the determination of how to get to the end result up to the program! Therefore, we don't need to lay out every step that needs to happen, like we do with imperative syntax.
